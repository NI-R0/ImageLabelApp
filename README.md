# üñºÔ∏è Image Label App

A lightweight Windows application that allows you to **label images via the right-click context menu** in File Explorer. Label `Favourites` is preset but one can create as many labels as he wants; the app keeps track of them in a local SQLite database. The labeled images are automatically copied into virtual folders based on their labels.
